## Learning the Blender Interface

In this section, you will become more familiar with the basic interface, which includes:

- 3D Viewport
  - The 3D viewport in Blender is a 2D rectangle that allows users to visualize and interact with a 3D scene. It's the main view that users see when they start Blender and is used for a variety of purposes, including modeling, animation, and texture painting.
- Outliner
  - The Outliner is the list of items in your blender file, such as mesh items, lights, materials, etc. This is where you will see your scene collections.
- Properties Panel
  - The Properties Panel in Blender is a user interface element that displays and allows editing of active data, such as the scene and object. The panel has several categories, or tabs, that group properties and settings by data type.

**Mentor’s Note:** Save a lot. Save Often. Make it a habit to constantly save your progress. If you like what you made, **Press Save**!

### Table Asset Creation: A Step-by-Step Guide


1. **Start with a cube**: Press **Shift + A** and choose **Mesh > Cube**.

1. **Scaling and Shaping**: Use the **S** key to resize the cube to the desired table size.

1. **Extruding:** Pressing **TAB** to go into edit mode, choose the face select tool, and select the top face. Press **E** to extrude by the** Z** axis. That will be your tabletop. You will use these same steps to create a drawer in the front face, Including** I** for Inset.

1. **Creating Table Legs and adding edge loops:** Pressing **CTRL-R** to create edge loops to create some geometry for legs.
    - Note: This is a good time to experiment with symmetry, this will help create a more symmetrical and even build. The symmetry gizmo is located on the upper right-hand side of the **3D Viewport** in **Edit mode**.

    The image below will show the symmetry turned on by the X-axis, indicating mirrored actions. Take the time to experiment with symmetry!

1. **Make a Drawer:** We’re going to go back to the face we left over specifically to build the drawer.
    - **Extrude Face:** Pressing **E** to extrude, Just enough to fill the space inside the table.
    - **Inset: **Selecting the top face you're going to press** I **to inset.
    - **Extrude Face: E **Extruding that top face down to create the inside of the drawer.
1. **Make a knob:** Let’s make a quick little knob for the drawer.
    - **Create a Cube: Shift + A** create cube. Here we are going to learn how to create a UV sphere.
    - **Add Modifier:** Here you are going to go to the right and look for the **Modifier tab**, Then select subdivision modifier. Then bring up 2 levels in the level viewport slider. Then Apply.
    - **Extrude and model:** Pressing **X** then the **Y** axix you're going to squish in the sphere giving it a slight disk shape to form the knob. Selecting the 4 middle faces on one side of the sphere you're going to **E** extrude outwards creating the stem of the knob.

**Mentor’s Note:** Be sure to make this Build your own and experiment with your own style!

Shown here are the different stages of the table being built! Sometimes it's good to take a step back and look at the stages from a distance. If it looks close to this, you're doing great!

## Introduction to UV Unwrapping

Now that we’ve got our models, let's talk about UV unwrapping. This process allows us to apply textures to our 3D models.

**Mentor Note:** UV editing in Blender is the process of mapping a 2D image onto a 3D object, which gives the model more realism and control over how textures appear. The UV Editor is used to create and edit UV maps, which are flat areas that show how each face of a 3D object should be textured with a part of the 2D image.

### Unwrapping the Book Asset: Step-by-Step Guide

1. **UV Editing Mode:** Select the book in object mode and locate the UV editing mode at the top center of the Blender interface. Now that we have the UV tab selected the screens will split. The left side will be the UV viewport, the right will be the 3D viewport.

1. **Mark Seam:** Start by going into edge select mode and selecting the upper corner seams of the book, following your way around that very line. After that has been done press Right Click> Mark Seam, afterward select the inner seam running parallel to the same set of edge loops, and repeat. Creating seams as if you were cutting a pattern on a piece of paper.

1. **Project from View:** Now that all seams have been marked let's start unwrapping. Press A to select all, This ensures the proper parts are selected to work on. Afterward, on the upper side or the 3D Viewport, Locate the UV drop-down menu and select Project from View.

1. **Unwrap:** On the left-hand side in the UV viewport locate the projected model. Press A to select all. Afterward, Right Click>Unwrap and you will see the book unwrapped flat! In 2D form.
