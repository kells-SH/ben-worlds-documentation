# __Scripting Workarounds__  

## Local UIs not Loading Images on Binding Change  
  Local UIs are not loading previously unseen images when bindings change  
   <br>
  **Steps**:	Create a default-scripted UI somewhere in the world and fill it with all the UI images you’ll need the player to see, thereby pre-caching them.  
   <br>
  Local clients are unable to unload images they no longer need, causing high memory usage and a finite cap on images that can be cached in this way
